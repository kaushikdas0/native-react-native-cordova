# React Native - Expo - CRNA - OR BACK TO NATIVE? 
## How to decide if React Native, CRNA or Expo is good enough for your next project?  
Following list you can use to decide if your app can be built with RN / EXPO or you need to choose native build.
My preference is Expo > RN > Native. So my first choise is Expo, then React Native and then Native, and the only reason is based on easy in development, but end of the day the functionility you are going to build will be the decicsion point on what to use.
